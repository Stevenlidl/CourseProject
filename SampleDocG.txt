Discriminative classifier 2 k nearest neighbors. Find k examples in the training set that are most similar to the text object to be classified neighbor documents. Assign category that is most common in these neighbor text objects. Neighbors vote for category. Can be improved by considering the distance of a neighbor. a closer neighbor has more influence. Can feb regarded as a way to directly estimate the conditional probability of label given data i e p of y given x. Needs a similarity function to measure similarity of text objects. General evaluation methodology. Have humans create a test collection where eery document is tagged with the desired categories ground truth. Generate categorization results using a system on the test collection. Compare the system categorization decisions with the human made decisions and quantify their similarity. The higher the similarity the better the results are. Similarity can be measured from different perspectives ti understand the qualtiy if the results inn detail. e g which category performs better. In general different categorization mistakes may have a different cost that inevitably depends on specific applications but it is okay to not confsider such a cost variation for relative comparison of methods.
