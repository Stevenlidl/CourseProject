#so now what?
#I need to take the info from the typo_finder function in that .py file.
#and output it in a meaningful way
#and try to use the timestamp info as well
# how do I get the info from the other file?
# how do I get the timestamp info? use the dict that Dani made?
# so for each word in the typo_list, output that and then...
# go into the dict??

#import packages and other files
import re
import os
import math
import typo_finder
import unigram_testing

# okay, now what?
# where do I start?
# I guess I go through the list of typos in typo_finder
