[MUSIC] Test representation and enabled analysis. Text representation deteremines what kind of mining algorithms can bu used. Multiple ways of representing test are possible. Strings, words, [INAUDIBLE], structures, logical predicates. Can should be combined in real applications. This course focuses on web based representation. General and robust, applicable to any language. No little manual effort. Suprisiingly powerful for many applications not all. Can be combined with more sophisticated representations. What is a word association. Why mine word associations. How to mine word associations. Basic word representations. Paradigmatic versus syntagmatic. Paradigmatic. A and b have paradigmatic relations if they can be substituted for each other. Syntagmatic. A and b have sntagmatic relation if they can be combined with each other. These two basic and [INAUDIBLE] relations can be generalized to describe relations of any items in a language. They are useful for improving accuracy of many NLP tasks. POS tagging, parsing, entity recognition, acronym expansion. Grammar learning. They are directly useful for many applications in text retrieval and mining.
