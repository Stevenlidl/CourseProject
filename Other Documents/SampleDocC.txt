[MUSIC] Syntagmatic relation discover and entropy. Whenever eats occurs, what other words also tend to occur. Is word w present or absent in this segment. Binary random variable X sub W. The more random X sub W is, the more difficult the prediction would be. How does one quantitatively measure the randomness of a random variable like x sub w. For what x sub w does h of x sub w reach maximum or minimum. X sub coin tossing a coin. Prediction question is meat present or absent in this segment. Does the presence of eats help predict the presence of meat. Does it reduce the uncertainly of meat. Conditional entropy for mining syntagmatic relations. For each word W1. For every other word w2 [INAUDIBLE] compute conditional entropy. Sort all the candidate words in ascending order H of x sub w1 given x sub w2. Take the top ranked candidate words that have potential syntagmatic relations with w1. Need to use a threshold for each w1. How can we name the strongest k syntagmatic relations from a collecion. How much reduction in the entropy of x can we obtain by knowing y. Mutual relation for syntagmatic relation mining. Which words have high mutual information with eats.
